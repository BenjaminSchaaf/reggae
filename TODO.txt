Phobos lessons:
  - "Compile-time" link rule must have an easy way to concatenate objects
  - Top-level targets that aren't built by default (like the unit test ones)
  - Possibility of picking per-package or per-module on a target basis (unit tests...)


Distinguish LinkFlags vs CompilerFlags?
Any order of parameters

Crazy idea: build server? In: list of changed files, out: build.

Refactoring:
  range.d
  Review all uses of @trusted
  Use ranges instead of arrays where possible

Compute dependencies for reggaefile.d itself - what if it imports other modules?
Static libraries
Use CC, CXX, LD environment variables
Optimise run-time
  Write source files once and create static library to link buildgen
Automatic selection of files based on OS/arch/etc.
Finding of C/C++ libraries (Qt, boost, libevent)
