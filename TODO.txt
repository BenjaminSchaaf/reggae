Bug: phony depending on real target creates double dependencies

Compute dependencies for reggaefile.d itself - what if it imports other modules?
Use CC, CXX, LD environment variables
Better static library support
Optimise run-time: only write srcs once, build static lib to link to reggaefile

Any order of parameters
Distinguish LinkFlags vs CompilerFlags?

Crazy idea: build server? In: list of changed files, out: build.

Refactoring:
  range.d
  Use ranges instead of arrays where possible
  Review all uses of @trusted

Automatic selection of files based on OS/arch/etc.
Finding of C/C++ libraries (Qt, boost, libevent)
