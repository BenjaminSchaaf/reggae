More complicated builds (e.g. vibe.d)
Re-generate the build when the dub information changes
dub fetch
Don't include dub packages that are only used for a specific configuration (unittest)
Semi-realistic example with multiple outputs
Make global configuration available
Use ranges instead of arrays where possible
Type-safe dCompile, etc.
Review all uses of @trusted
travis
Make it possible to choose which compiler to use for each language
Static libraries
Optimise run-time
  Write source files once and create static library to link buildgen
CMake-like rules for rerunning itself
Tup backend
Binary backend
Automatic selection of files based on OS/arch/etc.
