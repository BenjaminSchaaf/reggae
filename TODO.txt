Semi-realistic example with multiple outputs
Make global configuration available
travis
Investigate why vibe says it needs libev, why certain dub packages don't work
Don't include dub packages that are only used for a specific configuration (unittest)
Use ranges instead of arrays where possible
Type-safe dCompile, etc.
Review all uses of @trusted
Make it possible to choose which compiler to use for each language
Static libraries
Optimise run-time
  Write source files once and create static library to link buildgen
Tup backend
Binary backend
Automatic selection of files based on OS/arch/etc.
